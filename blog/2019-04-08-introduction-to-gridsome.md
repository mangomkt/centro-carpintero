# Is it safe to renovate my home during Covid-19?

When the pandemic started everything sort of went through a brief pause, but then gradually things started opening up, people started trying new hobbies and projects, and whether you are maybe thinking of renovating your home during the pandemic or maybe already started, a while ago before the pandemic, we are going to highlight if it is safe and what are we has a home renovation company are doing:

## Safety Tips:

So if you already started or are planning to renovate your home this are some things to keep in mind:

* Communicate first with your contractors: ask before hiring them, what safety measures are they taking with the pandemic.
* Don't do it yourself: it's always important when it comes to renovating your house that you hire someone who has experience in renovations. I know we all want to be handyman but if you do not have any experience and didn't hire anyone because of the pandemic and did it yourself, that could lead to injuring yourself or someone else.
* Be mindful: it's important to respect those who are renovating your house, so being extra careful keeping your distance brings safety for you and those around you.	
* Be patient: since the pandemic started some businesses have been going a bit slower because of backorder issues of certain materials.

### What safety precautions are we taking?

Here in Centro Carpintero we want to show that we respect our costumes by following these safety procedures:

* On-site training and individual set-up with masks and hand sanitizers.
* Regularly spraydown the tools and equipment, including locks and trailers.
* Sanitizing everything in the workplace. 
* Keeping workers showing coronavirus symptoms off the site, even if those symptoms might be caused by seasonal allergies.
