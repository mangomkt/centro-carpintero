# The types of wood we use and its pros and cons

Wood is one of the oldest and common materials used for building around the world , especially here in Mexico, It is used to make furniture, cabinets, and for custom fine carpentry. In fact what's amazing is that there's approximately 52 different types of wood in Mexico, but we are only going to focus on the 3 main types of wood we use in our fine carpentry. Those are Parota, Primavera and Amapa (rosewood) and we're going to highlight there pros and its cons:
