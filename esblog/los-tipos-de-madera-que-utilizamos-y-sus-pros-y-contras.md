Wood is one of the oldest and common materials used for building around the world , especially here in Mexico. It is used to make furniture, cabinets, and for custom fine carpentry. In fact what's amazing is that there's approximately 52 different types of wood in Mexico, but we are only going to focus on the 3 main types of wood we use in our fine carpentry and home renovations. They are Parota, Primavera and Amapa (rosewood). Below are the pros and cons of each wood:

## Parota  
Parota wood, also called guanacaste, is primarily found in Mexico and in Central America. Its color is a golden-brown. A beautiful wood to use for furniture designs.

  * It is affordable.
  * It contains a natural insect resistance that makes it termite proof.
  * Rot and water resistant. 

### Cons

  * Parota wood is hard-wood but it's still light weight so it may not be able (depending on how it's made) to withstand significant weight when using a dining table or dresser.



**Safety** : Parota wood can be toxic, and if it is not handled properly it can cause eye or respiratory infection, so make sure that you let a skilled and experienced carpenter do the work for you.


## Amapa (rosewood)
